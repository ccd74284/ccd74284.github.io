      <H1>Studying Abroad in Paris</H1>
      <p>This summer I had the unique opportunity to travel to Paris through a University of Georgia Study Abroad Program. While in Paris I studied the history of tourism in France, along with global terrorism. We stayed in a dorm in the heart of Paris in the 7th arrondissement.</p>
          <H2>The Sights</h2>
      <p align="left">Throughout my six weeks abroad I saw many historical and famous landmarks around Paris. Every day after our half day of class, I would venture out with friends to see new places.</p>
    <H3>Traveling</h3>
                <p align="left">During the program, we had free weekends that allowed us to travel outside of Paris. One weekend I traveled to Venice and Florence, in Italy, and the other weekend took me to London. Italy has always been a place I wanted to visit so I took the opportunity to visit on our very long weekend. We initially flew to Venice. Venice was everything I thought it would be and more, despite the crazy summer crowds.</p>
