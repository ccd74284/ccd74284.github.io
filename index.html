      <H1>Studying Abroad in Paris</H1>
      <p>This summer I had the unique opportunity to travel to Paris through a University of Georgia Study Abroad Program. While in Paris I studied the history of tourism in France, along with global terrorism. We stayed in a dorm in the heart of Paris in the 7th arrondissement and spent the eight weeks exploring Paris and more.</p>

          <H2>The Sights</h2>
      <p align="left">Throughout my six weeks abroad I saw many historical and famous landmarks around Paris. Every day after our half day of class, I would venture out with friends to see new places. Paris is filled with so many interesting places, such as the Eiffel Tower, the Luxembourg Gardens, and so many museums. My three favorite sights in Paris were the Opera Garnier, the Champs de Elysse and the Eiffel Tower. The Opera Garnier is the opera house in Paris where there are frequent musical and ballet performances. Although I was unable to make it to a performance, I visited the Opera Garnier many times and was blown away by the beauty and intricacy of the building. The Champs de Elysse is the famous road which is home to numerous restaurants, shops and the Arc de Triomphe. Many afternoons were spent walking along the street and venturing into stores and restaurants. If you are willing to walk up the many stairs, the view from the Arc de Triomphe is breathtaking. The Eiffel Tower is a staple of Paris and anyone who visits must see the iconic landmark at least once. I even went to the top and saw the amazing views of the entire city. There is an abundance of sights to be seen in Paris and I made sure to not leave any out. </p>
    <H3>Traveling</h3>
                <p align="left">During the program, we had free weekends that allowed us to travel outside of Paris. One weekend I traveled to Venice and Florence, in Italy, and the other weekend took me to London. Italy is a place I have always wanted to visit so I decided to travel to Venice and Florence for the long weekend. We initially flew to Venice, and it was everything I had envisioned it to be and more. Despite the crazy summer crowds, we were able to spend our day exploring the canals, visiting Saint Mark's Basilica, the Venice Opera House, going on gondola rides and eating authentic Italian food. Once we stepped off of the train in Florence we were immersed into a much different Italian city. The city was bustling with tourists and locals seeing the main sights and enjoying the warm summer weather. A few weeks later we ventured to London which is just a short flight away from Paris. London is very similar to Paris in that it is a very large city with an abundance of history. I was able to explore Buckingham and Kensington Palace, ride the London Eye at sunset, tour Westminster Abbey, and walk around Hyde Park. Throughout my visit London quickly became one of my all time favorite cities.</p>

      <H4>The Experience</h4>
      <p alighn="left">My experience abroad gave me a new appreciation for foreign cultures and travel. By the time I was leaving Paris I felt as if I had become a local of Paris and was sad to leave the city and the neighborhood I had lived in for eight weeks. I enjoyed studying abroad and traveling so much that I will be going to Ireland this summer on another UGA Study Abroad Program. Studying abroad truly gave me an opportunity to see a new part of the world and changed my entire college career, and I would encourage all college students to take the opportunity to travel before graduation.</p>
