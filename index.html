      <H1>Studying Abroad in Paris</H1>
      <p>This summer I had the unique opportunity to travel to Paris through a University of Georgia Study Abroad Program. While in Paris I studied the history of tourism in France, along with global terrorism. We stayed in a dorm in the heart of Paris in the 7th arrondissement.</p>
          <H2>The Sights</h2>
      <p align="left">Throughout my six weeks abroad I saw many historical and famous landmarks around Paris. Every day after our half day of class, I would venture out with friends to see new places.</p>
    <H3>Traveling</h3>
                <p align="left">During the program, we had free weekends that allowed us to travel outside of Paris. One weekend I traveled to Venice and Florence, in Italy, and the other weekend took me to London. Italy is a place I have always wanted to visit so I decided to travel to Venice and Florence for the long weekend. We initially flew to Venice, and it was everything I had envisioned it to be and more. Despite the crazy summer crowds, we were able to spend our day exploring the canals, visiting Saint Mark's Basilica, the Venice Opera House, going on gondala rides and eating authentic Italian food.</p>
    <H4>The Experience</h4>
      <p alighn="left">My experience abroad gave me a new appreciation for foreign cultures and travel. By the time I was leaving Paris I felt as if I had become a local of Paris and was sad to leave the city and the neighborhood I had lived in for eight weeks.</p>
